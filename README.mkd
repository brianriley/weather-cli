You've spent hours, days, months, maybe **years** customizing your terminal. And yet so many things draw your attention away from it.

GONE are the days of wasting non-terminal moments looking up the current weather! Now, ask your terminal:

    $ weather portland,me
    It's 9 degrees and light snow

Thank you terminal--I think I *will* spend more time inside with you.

Install
-------

    $ pip install weathercli

(Note that the command is `weather`, not `weathercli`.)
